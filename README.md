This repository contains the **AI-ready specification and context** for a web application that manages and presents information about institutions (e.g., educational facilities, public organizations).  
It is also an **experiment in specification-driven development with AI** ‚Äî using structured specs as the source of truth to guide code generation, validation, and evolution.

---

## üöÄ Project Vision
- A **web app** to browse institution information (address, contact, region).  
- **Iteration 1 (priority):** sort, filter, and search through institution data.  
- **Iteration 2:** manual edits of selected fields with **audit trail**.  
- **External modules** can update specific fields (e.g., emails) with provenance metadata.  
- **Future:** authentication, role-based access, rate limits, and integrations.

## üß© How to Use

- **For humans:**  
  Read `.cogitron/` files to understand the scope, requirements, and design.  
  Extend docs, add ADRs, evolve specs as the project grows.  

- **For AI models:**  
  Provide the [bootstrap prompt](.cogitron/prompts/bootstrap_prompt.md) to regenerate the project structure from scratch.  
  Use the [continuation prompt](.cogitron/prompts/continuation_prompt.md) to refine individual files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Status
- Scope and specs under active development.  
- Technology assumptions: Python/FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL DB, React frontend (to be confirmed in ADRs).  
- Current focus: defining data model, API, and non-functional requirements.  
- Experimental goal: validate a workflow where **AI consumes and evolves specifications** rather than raw code.
