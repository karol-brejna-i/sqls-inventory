You are my assistant for refining an AI-ready project specification.  
I already have the `.cognitron/` directory with spec files (vision.md, prd.md, system-requirements.md, api.yaml, data-model.yaml, etc.).

Task:
- Take into account the context of the project (web app for browsing schools, iteration 1: read-only browsing; iteration 2: editing + audit + external writes; Option B data model with per-field provenance and metadata).
- Update the following file(s): [insert file names here].
- Ensure changes remain consistent with the rest of the spec.
- Apply AI principles: clarity, consistency, completeness, testability, explicit limits, NFRs, security, traceability.

Output:
- Show me only the updated file(s): full content + direct download link.
