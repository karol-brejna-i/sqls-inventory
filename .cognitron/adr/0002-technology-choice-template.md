# 0002 ‚Äî Technology Choice: [Short Title]

## Status
- Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Rejected
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
- What requirement or constraint triggered this choice?  
  (e.g., ‚ÄúNeed relational DB with strong JSON support and full-text search to handle school data queries and metadata.‚Äù)

- What alternatives were considered?  
  (e.g., Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, ‚Ä¶)

- What non-functional requirements influenced this?  
  (performance, scalability, maturity, ecosystem, skills in team, licensing, ops overhead)

## Decision
- Technology chosen: **[name + version]**  
- Scope: where it will be used (backend framework, database, search engine, etc.)  
- Key rationale: why it fits the requirements better than alternatives.

## Consequences
- ‚úÖ Benefits: what advantages this brings (e.g., full-text search, mature ecosystem, known by team).  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-offs: downsides, risks, or lock-ins.  
- üìå Migration considerations: how to replace it in the future if needed.  
- üîç Monitoring points: what should be measured/verified to ensure the choice holds (e.g., latency, cost, scaling).
